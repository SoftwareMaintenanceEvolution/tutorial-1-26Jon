## About Me as a Software Engineering Student
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering with a passion for solving problems and building innovative software solutions. As an SE student, I love exploring different areas of software development, from designing intuitive user interfaces to working on the backend systems that power them. My academic journey has given me the opportunity to work with various programming languages and tools, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn more and expand my skillset.

## Expectations from This Course
I'm excited to join the Software Maintenance and Evolution course because it will help me:

- Gain a deeper understanding of maintaining software systems over their lifecycle and learn techniques for refactoring, bug fixing, and adapting software to changing requirements.
- Develop skills in managing legacy systems, analyzing the impact of changes, and applying industry best practices for software evolution.
- Enhance my knowledge of version control, configuration management, and release management for maintaining robust and scalable software.
- Learn how to tackle technical debt, ensuring that the software remains maintainable and adaptable in the future.
